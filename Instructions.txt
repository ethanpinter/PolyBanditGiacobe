Hello!

Welcome to the game!

Here are instructions on how to play:

Every level has a password that you must find on the previous level.
To find the specific instructions on each level, there will be a README file.
Cat the README file to see the instructions, and find the password.

To log onto the next level, type ssh level(levelnumber)@localhost into the command prompt. Enter the password when prompted.

Good luck!
